#  Must Have Additions Mod

## Overview
This mod adds features that should be in the main game, but for some reason aren't. Some are great, some are silly, but all are important!
A project made for fun and for applying my Java knowledge.

***This mod is for Fabric Mod Loader. Porting to other loaders is not planned for the future.***
